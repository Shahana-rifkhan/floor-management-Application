**Key Libraries and Tools**
---------------------------

| **Library/Tool**          | **Purpose**                                   |
|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| **React**                 | Core framework for building the UI.          |
| **Context API**           | State management for tables and rooms.       |
| **react-dnd**             | Enables drag-and-drop functionality.         |
| **react-hook-form**       | Simplifies form handling.                    |
| **Jest/React Testing Library** | Unit tests for components.               |
| **Cypress**               | End-to-end testing (optional).               |


**How It Works**
----------------

### **Drag-and-Drop Tables**

*   Uses react-dnd to provide intuitive drag-and-drop functionality for positioning tables on the floor plan.
    
*   Adjustments are saved in local storage for persistence.
    

### **Room and Table Details**

*   Context API is used to manage the global state of rooms and tables.
    
*   Forms handled using react-hook-form ensure validation and state updates are efficient.
    

### **Statistics**

*   A custom hook, useTableStatistics, computes live statistics like total tables and covers.
    

**Future Enhancements**
-----------------------

*   Add backend integration using Node.js and MongoDB/PostgreSQL.
    
*   Enable user authentication for personalized layouts.
    
*   Add advanced room and table settings (e.g., dynamic room resizing).
    
*   Introduce real-time collaborative editing.
